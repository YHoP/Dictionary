project: Create a program that lets users create a dictionary.<br>
Make two classes: one for Word, and one for Definition. The homepage of the app should list out all of the words, and let you click on them to view all of their definitions. A user should be able to add a word, and when viewing a word, be able to add one or more definitions.<br>
